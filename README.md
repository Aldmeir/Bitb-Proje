# üé≠ BitB (Browser-in-the-Browser) Attack Simulation with Evilginx2

This project demonstrates how the **BitB (Browser-in-the-Browser)** phishing technique works in combination with **Evilginx2**, for the purpose of research, simulation, and training on phishing detection.

All data entered by the user is collected **locally** on a Node.js backend server for analysis and demonstration purposes.

## üß© How It Works

Upon visiting the page, the user is presented with two login options:

- **Sign in with Microsoft**
- **Sign in with Gmail**

![Login Options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97a5fb7a-869a-4a7c-b57c-ccfab88fbb83)

---

When the user clicks one of these buttons, a **fake browser window** is displayed inside an `iframe`. Despite showing legitimate domain names in the address bar (e.g. `https://login.microsoftonline.com`, `https://accounts.google.com`), the content is actually rendered from a custom **HTML template** under our control.

In this simulation, we continue by selecting **Sign in with Microsoft**.

### Step-by-Step Interaction

The fake browser window prompts the user to interact with a cloned Microsoft login page:

![Form Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e93b7d-4c52-45da-8aba-0be51e32f0e9)

---

![Final Prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a44d07ac-50ea-4cd4-b8aa-4cd8a0fc398e)

---

When the user clicks **"Yes"**, the iframe closes and the entered credentials are sent to the backend, where they are stored in a `.txt` file on the attacker's local machine.

## üîó Evilginx2 Integration

This BitB phishing simulation can be extended with **Evilginx2** to:

- Perform real-time MITM attacks using predefined phishlets
- Capture session cookies (JWT, bearer tokens, etc.)
- Evade 2FA and gain persistent session access

Evilginx2 acts as a reverse proxy to handle real authentication endpoints, while the BitB frontend handles the **visual deception** and interaction layer.
